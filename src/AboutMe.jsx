          <p>
            I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (HONS) in Electronic & Information Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am passionate about programming, problem-solving, and developing innovative solutions in embedded systems and IoT. During my studies, I gained hands-on experience through various projects, including creating a robot car using STM32 and developing a convenient store simulation game using Unity.
          </p>

            I have also worked as a Software Engineering Trainee at Simatelex and held part-time positions as a STEM teacher and Electronic and Software Engineer at Aloes Trees EdTech Limited. These experiences have honed my skills in Python, C, Java, and embedded software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow professionally in the field of software engineering and embedded systems.
